Day 2
=====================
Class Videos
------------
Videos relevant to today's work will be interspersed with yesterday's videos
* [Git and Github](https://vimeo.com/321543564)
* [Javascript Fundamentals](https://vimeo.com/321562784)


Git & Github
-----------------
* Git isn't the same as Github. Git is a `Version Control` system while Github is where the systems you are working on are stored
* A way to think about Git being a version control system is thinking of Google Docs. Google Docs keeps track of every change you make with a timestamp so that you can go back to earlier `states`
* [Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
* Github is where employers look at what you do every day and is basically an ever expanding resume
* Github really revolutionized Git with its concepts of desposable branches
* Git and Github is useful when you have a lot of developers and need to keep track 

Setting up Git/Github via command line
-------------------------------------------
* Everyone should have a Github account
* We installed `git` using Homebrew yesterday, so let's get started on some challenges!

Practice
-----------------------
* [Git Challenge](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/git-challenge)
* [More Git Practice](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)
* [Command Line Challenge](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/command-line)

JS Fundamentals
---------------
* [JS Notes](/week-01/JSFundamentalsDay1.pdf)

Pair Programming
---------------------
* Agile software development technique
* 2 developers, one keyboard/mouse
* Roles: Driver / Navigator (these roles switch every so often to give the other person a chance to practice being the other role)
	* Driver: Writer of the code
	* Navigator: Observes the person driving and provides direction/review
* Why is this a good thing?
	* Learning is faster - you pick up a lot of things from the other developer
	* Cleaner code - another person can review it right away so when you submit, it's way cleaner
	* Mentality: you have to fully formulate a thought before it coming out of your mouth so that you're not lost in your thoughts. Also, having someone to bounce ideas off of means that you're not lost in your thoughts
		* Rubber ducky programming / Rubber ducking / other variations is the thought that a programmer would carry around a rubber duck to talk through code when stuck or figuring out next steps.


Practice
--------
These repos have files for both Javascript and Ruby. For now, just complete the challenges in JS. We'll go over Ruby tomorrow, and then you can go back and complete the challenges in Ruby.
