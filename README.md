# Code Platoon Public Curriculum

### Welcome
Code Platoon's mission is to help bridge the gap between a military career and the tech world by turning veterans and military spouses into software developers in a condensed timeframe. In this repository, you will find the first three weeks of curriculum for Code Platoon's Full-Time Immersive Web Developer Program. This curriculum will include daily challenges and links to any necessary resources. The folders provided represent the material from weeks 1 through 3.

### Getting started on Code Platoon's Self-Paced Program.
If you are new to coding, you should start by [going through part our Intro To Coding](https://www.codeplatoon.org/intro-to-coding/). Once you have completed the Intro To Coding, head over to Week 1. If you are already comfortable with the coding questions in Free Code Camp, you can skip to week 1 directly.

In the case that you want access to the full self-paced program and/or have questions about the Full-Time Immersive Web Developer Program, please email Rod Levy: rod@codeplatoon.org
