# Code Platoon Curriculum 2017

## Welcome Message
Veterans, thank you for your service to our country. Code Platoon NFP's mission is to help bridge the gap between a  military career and the tech world by turning veterans into software developers in a condensed timeframe.
In this repository, you will find the curriculum for our first three weeks of classroom instruction with videos of our current class, Charlie Platoon. This curriculum will include daily challenges and links to any necessary resources.
