Regular Expressions in Ruby
--------------------------------
* Regex === Regular Expressions
* What are regular expressions?
	* Patterns used to match character combinations
	* Each language has slightly different patterns but the concept of pattern matching is the same
	* It basically works like this:
		* A user inputs some text
		* Your compiler, using whatever language you decide, reads that input and pattern-matches it.
		* If it passes, do one thing. If it does not, do something else
	* This is useful for something like phone number inputs
		* You will hate phone number inputs because people are ridiculous
		* Some use parenthesis, some use periods, some use dashes and some terrible people smash all the phone numbers together.
	* Also useful for social security numbers

Regular Expressions in Javascript
--------------------------------
* Just like with our first week, all of the concepts related to Regular Expressions are common to both JS and in Ruby, just syntactically different
* [Regex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) for JS

Destructive vs. non-destructive methods
--------------------------------------------
* Methods exist in both Ruby and Javascript that alter the original data structure you are dealing with
* You will just have to look up and mess around with destructive methods until you memorize them.
* Javascript calls these malleable methods
* Ruby calls these destructive methods. Here's a trick: in Ruby, if you see a bang symbol, `!`, after a method call, it is _generally_ a destructive method
